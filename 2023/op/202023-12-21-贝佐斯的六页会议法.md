12月15日，亞馬遜的創辦人Bezos（退休後不知何時開始練得超壯）接受Lex Fridman的訪問聊了很多經營管理，其中一個就是講到經典的管理方式6頁memo開會提高效率。

他在訪問中解釋了為什麼，開會全場當場花30分鐘讀 memo 比聽 PPT 報告有效很多，長期節省了時間、提升效率。

我们平时怎么开会？

报告人会打开电脑，展示他做的 PPT。其他人坐在台下，听他讲 PPT。

I'll break through some meetings like that. He actually described the Chris document like this is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon, of the way you approach meetings, is the six page memo, maybe 1st, described the process of of our meeting with Memos and meetings at Amazon and Blue Origin are unusual when we when we get new, when new people come in, like a new executive joints, they're a little taken aback sometimes, because the typical meeting will start with the six page, narrowly structured memo, and we do study hall, wait for 30 min We sit there silently together in the meeting and read like notes in the margins. and then we then we discuss. And the reason, by the way, we do study, you could say, I would like everybody to read these memos in advance, but the problem is, people don't have time to do that, and they end up coming to the meeting having only scared them amo or maybe not ready at all, and they're trying to catch up and also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading. It's better just to carve out the time for people and do it now with all the same page. We've all read the memo, and now we can have a really elevated discussion. And this is so much better from having a slide show presentation, you know, a powerpoint presentation of some kind work that has so many difficulties. But one of the problems is powerpoint is really designed to persuade. It's kind of a sales tool. And internally, the last thing you want to do is sell. You want to you're getting your truth seeking. You're trying to find truth. And the other problem with powerpoint is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience. And a memo is the opposite. It's hard to write a six pension. A good six page minimum might take two weeks to write. You have to write it. You have to rewrite it. You have to edit it. You have to talk to people about it. They have to poke holes in it for you. You write it again, It may take two weeks. So the author its really a very difficult job. But for the audience, it's much better. So you can read a half hour. And, you know, there are little problems with powerpoint presentations too. You know, senior executives interrupt with questions halfway through the presentation. Question is gonna be answer on the next slide. But you never got there was to read the whole memo in advance. You you know, I often write lots of questions that I have in the margins of these memos, and then I go across them all out, because by the time I get to the end of the memo, they've been answering. So I save all that time. You also get, you know, if the person is preparing the memo, we talked earlier about, um, you know, group think, and, you know, the fact that I go last in meetings, and that you don't want, you know, your ideas to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely. Um, you know, the author of the memo is is has kind of got to be very vulnerable. They got to put all their thoughts out there, and they've got to go 1st. But that's great because it makes them really good. And so and you get to see their real ideas, and you're not trampling on them accidentally. You're a big, you know, powerpoint presentation. What's that feel like when you've authored a thing, and then you're sitting there and everybody is reading your thing, you're like, I think it's mostly terrifying. Yeah, like, maybe in a good place. I think it's just terrifying. I think it's terrifying in a in a productive way, um, but I think it's emotionally a very nerve racking experience. Is there a art science to the writing of the six page memo, or just writing in general, to you the I mean, it's really got to be a real memo. So it means paragraphs have topic sentences, its verbs and nouns. You can't that's the other problem with powerpointers, they often just bullet points, and you can, you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points. When you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure, it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking. So it does it. It forces the author to be at their best. And so you're getting somebody, they're getting somebody really their best thinking, and then you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to tease that thinking out of the person. And you've got it from the very beginning. So it really saves you time in the long run s.

我会在这样的会议中突围。他实际上描述克里斯的文件就像这是亚马逊传奇的一个方面，你对待会议的方式，是六页的备忘录，也许第一，描述了我们会议的过程，在亚马逊和蓝色起源的会议是不寻常的当我们当我们有新的人进来的时候，比如一个新的主管，他们有时会有点吃惊，因为典型的会议将以六页的，结构狭窄的备忘录开始，我们在自习室，等待30分钟，我们在会议中安静地坐在一起阅读空白处的笔记。然后我们然后我们讨论。顺便说一下，我们学习的原因是，你可以说，我希望每个人都提前阅读这些备忘录，但问题是，人们没有时间这样做，他们最后来开会只是害怕，或者根本没有准备好，他们试图赶上来，也在虚张声势，就像他们在大学里假装阅读一样。最好是为人们挤出时间，现在就做，而且都是同一页。我们都读了备忘录，现在我们可以进行真正高层次的讨论了。这比用幻灯片演示要好得多，你知道，用幻灯片演示一些有很多困难的工作。但其中一个问题是，ppt的设计目的是说服。这是一种销售工具。在内部，你最不想做的就是出售。你想要你正在寻求真相。你在努力寻找真相。ppt的另一个问题是，它对作者来说很容易，对观众来说却很难。而备忘录则是相反的。要写一张6英镑的退休金是很难的。写一篇至少6页的好文章可能需要两周的时间。你必须写出来。你必须重写它。你必须编辑它。你得和别人谈谈。他们得给你戳个洞。你再写一遍，可能需要两周时间。所以作者是一份非常困难的工作。但对观众来说，这就好多了。所以你可以读半个小时。而且，你知道，ppt也有一些小问题。你知道，高管们会在演示进行到一半时打断提问。问题的答案会在下一张幻灯片上给出。但你从来没有提前读过整个备忘录。你知道，我经常在这些备忘录的空白处写下很多问题，然后我把它们都写出来，因为当我读到备忘录最后的时候，他们已经回答了。所以我节省了所有的时间。你也知道，如果这个人在准备备忘录，我们之前说过，嗯，你知道，团队思考，你知道，我在会议上最后一个，你不想，你知道，你的想法过早地污染了会议。你知道，这份备忘录的作者是他一定是很脆弱的。他们必须把所有的想法都表达出来，他们必须得第一名。但这很好，因为这让他们真的很好吃。所以你可以看到他们真正的想法，你不会无意中践踏他们的想法。你是一个大的，你知道的，ppt演示。当你写了一个东西，然后你坐在那里，每个人都在读你的东西，你会觉得，我觉得这很可怕。是啊，也许在一个好地方。我觉得这太可怕了。我认为这是一种很可怕的一种有益的方式，但我认为这在情感上是一种非常紧张的经历。写六页的备忘录有什么艺术科学吗，或者只是一般的写作，对你来说，我的意思是，它真的必须是一个真正的备忘录。这意味着段落有主题句，它的动词和名词。你不能，这是ppt的另一个问题，它们通常只是项目符号，你可以，你可以在项目符号后面隐藏很多草率的想法。当你必须用叙事结构的完整句子写作时，你很难隐藏自己的草率思维。所以它做到了。它迫使作者处于最佳状态。所以你得到了一个人，他们得到了一个人真正最好的想法，然后你不需要花很多时间试图从这个人那里得到那些想法。你从一开始就知道了。所以从长远来看，这确实节省了你的时间。
