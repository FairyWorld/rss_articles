## ELSA AI

### English

I have previously introduced an app called ELSA, which is the preferred tool for practicing English speaking. It has a daily learning plan, and all you need to do is follow the instruction and read out the text. It will analyze your pronunciation (see Figure 1).

Recently, they released ELSA AI and gave me an account. After trying it out, I feel that the English training industry might really be replaced by software in the future.

AI can simulate various scenarios such as interviews, shopping, dining, etc., allowing you to have a conversation with it (see Figure 2). It then analyzes your performance and points out your mistakes (see Figure 3).

ELSA is a paid software, and has a 7-day free trial period. It is a 5-star app on Google/Apple stores (Figure 4), and friends in need can consider it. Now, there is a promotion on the official website, 40% off the annual fee: the pro version without AI https://elsaspeak.com/inf/EnglishFluencyJourney/, the premium version with AI https://elsaspeak.com/inf/englishfluencyjourney1/

### Chinese

以前我介绍过一个 App，练习英语口语的首选工具，名字叫做 ELSA。它有每天的学习计划，你只要跟着读，它就会分析你的发音（图一）。

最近，他们推出了 AI 版，还送了我一个账号。我体验以后，觉得英语培训业真的要被软件替代了。

AI 会模拟各种场景（面试、购物、就餐等等），让你跟她对话（图二），然后分析你的表现，指出哪里说得不对（图三）。

ELSA 是收费软件，不过有7天的免费试用期。它在谷歌/苹果商店都是五星好评（图四），需要的朋友可以考虑。现在，官网有优惠活动，年费六折，不含 AI 版本 https://elsaspeak.com/inf/EnglishFluencyJourney/ ，含 AI 的版本 https://elsaspeak.com/inf/englishfluencyjourney1/
